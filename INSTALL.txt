*******************************************************************************************
The preferred method for installing mfilemon is to use the automated installer available at

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mfilemon/

This procedure was intended for old versions that had no installer.

MFILEMON INSTALLATION
=====================
The supplied MONITOR.INF file should do the trick on Windows XP, but on Windows 2000
platforms it won't work (hey, if someone out there knows why, please tell me
the solution! The INF file is trivial and is derived from the DDK localmon sample).
Here comes a simple installation procedure:

WITH INF FILE
-------------
1) start control panel, printers
2) right-click on the printer that you want to be connected to MFILEMON, choose "Properties"
3) click on the "Ports" tab
4) click "Add port..."
5) click "New port type..."
6) click "Browse..."
7) select the MONITOR.INF from the folder where you unpacked MFILEMON
8) Windows will warn that the software is not certified blah blah blah, click "Continue"
9) now you have a new port type named "Multi File Port Monitor": you can select it and add
   a new port managed by MFILEMON.


WITHOUT INF FILE
----------------
1) copy mfilemon.dll and mfilemonUI.dll to %SystemRoot%\system32 folder
2) start a DOS prompt, enter the folder where you unpacked MFILEMON
3) execute "regmon.exe -r" to register the monitor DLLs.



MFILEMON REMOVAL
================
Removal procedure is manual.
1) make sure no printer driver is connected to a MFILEMON port, otherwise spooler will deny removal
2) start a DOS prompt, enter the folder where you unpacked MFILEMON
3) execute "regmon.exe -d" to deregister the monitor DLLs.
4) optionally, you can remove mfilemon.dll and mfilemonUI.dll from %SystemRoot%\system32 folder
